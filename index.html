			<h2>What is it?</h2>
			<section class="desc">
				<p>No Limit Texas Hold ’Em (NLHE) is arguably the most popular form of poker played today.</p>
				<br />
				<p>In comparison to other types of poker, the rules are quite simple. However, the strategy can be complex. For this reason, it’s said that NLHE takes minutes to learn but a lifetime to master.</p>
				<br />
				<p>Why No Limit? In each hand there's no restriction on the size of a player's bet. The only limit is the number of chips they have in front of them. The chance to win big on a single hand, or lose it all, is one reason behind the game’s popularity.</p>
			</section>
			<h2>How does it work?</h2>
			<section class="desc">
				<p>Texas Hold ‘Em is played across multiple hands. In each hand, a player aims to make the best possible five-card poker hand. They do this using a combination of their hole cards and the community cards.</p>
				<br />
				<p><span class="bold">Hole cards</span> are the two cards dealt to each player, face down, at the start of each hand.</p>
				<br />
				<p><span class="bold">Community cards</span> are the five cards dealt, face up, in the middle of the table. Each community card is available to every player and can be used in the hands of multiple players.</p>
				<br />
				<p>Players place bets during a hand, using poker chips. The player who wins the hand wins all the wagered chips (ie. the pot). If a player loses all of their chips, they are out of the game.</p>
			</section>
			<h2>What else should I know?</h2>
			<section class="desc">
				<p>At the start of each game of NLHE, the size of the minimum bet is established. This minimum bet size is referred to as the big blind.</p>
				<br />
				<p>There are also three important table positions:</p>
				<br />
				<ul>
					<li><span class="bold">Dealer</span>. Not surprisingly, they deal the cards. The dealer is identified by a white disc, called the button, placed in front of them.</li>
					<li><span class="bold">Small Blind (SB)</span>. The player to the immediate left of the dealer. At the start of the hand, the player in the SB must make a bet equal to half the size of the big blind.</li>
					<li><span class="bold">Big Blind (BB)</span>. The player to the immediate left of the SB. At the start of the hand, the player in the BB must make a bet equal to the size of the big blind.</li>
				</ul>
				<br />
				<p>All three positions rotate around the table, moving one position to the left at the end of each hand.</p>
			</section>
			<h2>Can you show me a hand?</h2>
			<section class="desc">
				<p>The sequence of play in a hand of NLHE is quite simple. The following steps will take you through a single hand of poker.</p>
				<h3>Setup</h3>
				<section class="step">
					<p>The player designated as the dealer is given the Dealer button.</p>
					<br />
					<p>The two players sitting in the Small Blind and Big Blind positions put out their mandatory bets (ie. the blinds).</p>
				</section>
				<h3>The Deal</h3>
				<section class="step">
					<p>Each player now receives their two hole cards. These are dealt clockwise, one at a time, starting with the player in the Small Blind.</p>
				</section>
				<h3>The 1st Betting Round</h3>
				<section class="step">
					<p>Players look at their cards and decide what action they want to take.</p>
					<br />
					<p>In turn, beginning with the player to the left of the Big Blind, each player performs one of the following:</p>
					<br />
					<ul>
						<li><span class="bold">Fold</span>, at which point they're out of the hand</li>
						<li><span class="bold">Call</span>, by matching the size of the current bet</li>
						<li><span class="bold">Raise</span>, by increasing the size of the bet</li>
					</ul>
					<br />
					<p>If any player makes a raise, other players may increase the bet further with a re-raise.</p>
				</section>
				<h3>The Flop</h3>
				<section class="step">
					<p>The wagered chips are gathered together to form the pot.</p>
					<br />
					<p>The first three community cards, called the flop, are dealt face-up in the middle of the table.</p>
				</section>
				<h3>The 2nd Betting Round</h3>
				<section class="step">
					<p>Beginning with the player to the left of the Dealer, the remaining players perform one of the following actions: make an initial <span class="bold">bet</span>, <span class="bold">fold</span>, <span class="bold">call</span>, <span class="bold">raise</span> or <span class="bold">re-raise</span></p>
					<br />
					<p>As long as no initial bet has been made, players may also <span class="bold">check</span>. That is, the player doesn't make a bet, but they remain in the hand.</p>
				</section>
				<h3>The Turn</h3>
				<section class="step">
					<p>The newly wagered chips are added to the pot.</p>
					<br />
					<p>The fourth community card, called the turn, is dealt face-up in the middle of the table.</p>
				</section>
				<h3>The 3rd Betting Round</h3>
				<section class="step">
					<p>Beginning with the player to the left of the Dealer, the remaining players perform one of the following actions: fold, check, bet, call, raise or re-raise.</p>
				</section>
				<h3>The River</h3>
				<section class="step">
					<p>The newly wagered chips are added to the pot.</p>
					<br />
					<p>The fifth community card, called the river, is dealt face-up in the middle of the table.</p>
				</section>
				<h3>The Final Betting Round</h3>
				<section class="step">
					<p>Beginning with the player to the left of the Dealer, the remaining players perform one of the following actions: fold, check, bet, call, raise or re-raise.</p>
				</section>
				<h3>The Showdown</h3>
				<section class="step">
					<p>The newly wagered chips are added to the pot.</p>
					<br />
					<p>The players remaining in the hand turn their hole cards face up for comparison.</p>
				</section>
				<h3>Winner Declared</h3>
				<section class="step">
					<p>The player with the best five-card hand is determined, and they are awarded the pot.</p>
				</section>
				<h3>Next Hand</h3>
				<section class="step">
					<p>The button moves one position to the left, and that player becomes the dealer.</p>
					<br />
					<p>Similarly, the player who was in the Big Blind becomes the Small Blind, and the player to their immediate left becomes the Big Blind.</p>
					<br />
					<p>They put out their bets, the cards are re-shuffled, and the next hand is ready to play.</p>
