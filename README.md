# General Assembly Front End Web Development (FEWD)

## Student Project

This was an individual project created for a part-time front end web dev course (Sept - Dec 2014).

The requirement was to create an interactive website, using at least HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript. A responsive site was preferred.

Any additional tech we wanted to use was at our discretion.

## Guide to Playing No Limit Texas Hold 'Em

[Go to the site](http://nlheguide.bitballoon.com/)

My project was a simple user guide for playing No Limit Texas Hold 'Em poker. It consists of:
- a landing page
- a page displaying a brief description of what the game is
- a page with a demo of how a hand of NLHE is played

### Demo page
The steps involved in a hand of NLHE can be moved through via PREV and NEXT buttons. At each step, a click of the DEMO button will provide a visual representation of the action.
